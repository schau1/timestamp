# timestamp

Project created for FreeCodeCamp API challenge: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice

- Pass a string as a parameter, and the app will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

- If the format is correct, returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

- If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

Example output: 
{ "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }
